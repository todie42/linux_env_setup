On MONSERVER
echo "[`date +%s`] PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT;HOSTNAME;test_critical;0;THIS IS ONLY A TEST" > /path/to/nagioshome/cmd/nagios.cmd

From a remote host I think you have to use NSCA
Might be able to use the check_dummy plugin, I saw that on several websites

ceck_command                   check_dummy!2

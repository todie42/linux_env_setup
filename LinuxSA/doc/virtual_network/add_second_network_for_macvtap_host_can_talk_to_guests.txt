#create network

#Make a file (/tmp/isolated) and put the following in it to create the new network


<network>
  <name>isolated</name>
    <ip address='NRIPADDRESS' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='NRIPADDRESS.2' end='NRIPADDRESS.254' />
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>


#Read files into KVM
virsh net-define /tmp/isolated.xml
virsh net-autostart isolated
virsh net-start isolated


#Add host to network

#Edit (using "virsh edit $guestname") the configuration of each guest that uses direct (macvtap) for its network connection and add a new <interface> in the <devices> section similar to the following:

<interface type='network'>
  <source network='isolated'/>
  <model type='virtio'/>
</interface>


shutdown, then restart each of these guests.

In bare server CentOS build had to enable each of the network cards then restart the network

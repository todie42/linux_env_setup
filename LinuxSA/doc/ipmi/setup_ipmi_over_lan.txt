in the BIOS setup ipmi over lan
Then you have to setup the password for the root user

ipmitool -I open user list 1
will show you which user is root
have to have that especially if the allow NULL user is set to NO


ipmitool user set password 2


# ipmitool lan set 1 ipsrc static
# ipmitool lan set 1 ipaddr <IPADDRESS>
# ipmitool lan set 1 netmask 255.255.255.0
# ipmitool lan set 1 defgw ipaddr <GATEWAY IP>
# ipmitool lan set 1 defgw macaddr <GATEWAY MAC>

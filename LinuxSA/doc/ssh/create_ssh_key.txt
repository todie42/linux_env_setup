On local machine
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "SOMETAG" -b 4096
ssh-keygen -b 4096

This will generate private and public key
ONLY USE PUBLIC KEY

The public key needs to be copied into the authorized_keys file on remote machine

This should copy it ... 
ssh-copy-id user@123.45.56.78

if not ...

On remote:
cp pub key from local machine
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
cat pubkeyfromlocal > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
ln -s authorized_keys2 authorized_keys



Then you should be able to login without password

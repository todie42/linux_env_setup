ssh -XY HOSTNAME


then if you do firefox it will display on your screen
firefox --no-remote

If that still doesn't work do:
ssh -XYv 

if the login says "debug1: Remote: No xauth program; cannot forward with spoofing."

  yum install xorg-x11-xauth

Then it should work


If you get 

E233: cannot open displayE852: The child process failed to start the GUI
Press ENTER or type command to continue


sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

X11Forwarding yes
X11UseLocalhost no

/etc/init.d/sshd reload

yum install xauth
